# Description

This repository includes my solutions to the problems of the Google Code Jam
competitions up to year 2021  made on a second thought.
The sources are in C++, and each source file contains a description of the algorithm used.
The C++ packages in the *Problems* directory contain source code grouped by Code Jam edition and round.
Unless otherwise noted, everything is judged as correct under practice mode.
